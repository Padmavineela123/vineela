            <p>
                &emsp; The COVID-19 vaccine has helped many people stay safe from the virus, but some have faced health problems after getting vaccinated. This project aims to find and support those people. We will collect information through surveys and talks to understand their health issues. Doctors and experts will help us check the problems and suggest possible solutions. We will also share important information with the community about vaccine side effects and how to get help. Our goal is to make sure people get the right care and feel safe about vaccination. This project will help improve healthcare and support those in need.
 
                <br> <br>
            
                &emsp; Vaccination has been one of the most effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19, saving millions of lives worldwide. However, some individuals have experienced health issues after receiving the vaccine. While most side effects are mild and temporary, a few people report more serious or prolonged health concerns. This project aims to identify and support those facing such challenges by understanding their symptoms, analyzing medical data, and raising awareness about available healthcare resources. <br> <br>
                
                &emsp; To achieve this, we will conduct surveys, interviews, and collaborate with medical professionals to gather accurate information. Our goal is to identify common post-vaccine symptoms, assess their impact on daily life, and explore potential remedies. This project will also serve as a platform to educate the community about vaccine-related health issues and provide guidance on seeking medical help when necessary. <br> <br>

                &emsp; Additionally, we aim to create awareness campaigns to inform people about both the benefits and possible risks of vaccination. Through open discussions and expert consultations, we seek to promote transparency and trust in immunization programs. By addressing public concerns, we hope to ensure better healthcare services and support systems for affected individuals. <br> <br>
